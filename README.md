# ARMuseum

Application mends the technology of Augmented Reality into a tourist museum mobile application. Its main purpose is to enhance the visitor's experience and make it more enjoyable.
The application was built using Google's ARCore SDK and OpenCV's Java SDK, version 4.5.5.
## Application Capabilities

The user can choose specific images to scan in order to play videos over them. This concept of Augmented Images was implemented with the help of Google's ARCore library.

The user has the ability to view information about the art piece, play the video once the image is detected, pause it, and also record a souvenir of the augmented experience.

## Necessary pre-requisites

The images must be pre-compiled in an imgdb database using Google's arcoreimg tool, available in the ARCore SDK.

## Major thanks

Big thanks and shout-out to [Luca Agnani Studio](http://www.lucaagnani.com/van-gogh-shadow.php) for giving me permission to use the videos in their project for immersion purposes.

Thank you to [Hey, Let's Code](https://github.com/heyletscode/Play-Video-On-Augmented-Image) for the inspiration of this project idea.
